<h2 align="left">What is A-Debug Lab?!</h2>

Ario Electronics has many products, so testing, QC, and repairing them is time-consuming. It also has many ideas that implementing all of them is too costly. Here is, A-Debug Lab comes to play.

A-Debug Lab is a laboratory where we can quickly test our existing product or estimate our futures product functionality. 
for example, we want to build a thermometer; there is two way front us: 

1. we can design our product entirely and make it.(God help us to make no mistake)
2. we can use A-Debug Lab to test all features we want for this product first and then make it.

Absolutely approach 2 is more logical.

For testing new hardware products, A-Debug Lab has almost everything that a hardware system needed includes tons of sensors, communication modules, microcontrollers, motors, LCDs, etc.
A-Debug Lab has software that can easily connect to the system and make testing easy for debugging existing products.

<h2 align="left">Is A-Debug Lab beneficial to everyone?</h2>

Absolutely yes.

You can use A-Debug Lab to prototype your product before losing any considerable cost. So what are you waiting for? :wink:
